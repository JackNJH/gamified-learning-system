|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|
| External JavaScript files '.js'               | `js/`       |
| External CSS files '.css'                     | `css/`       |
| Images used throughout the website (EXCLUDING chapter media, pfp, badges) | `images/`   |

| Parts of pages that can be reused between roles| `components/` |
| PHP files with no HTML (functions for certain actions)| `modules/` |
